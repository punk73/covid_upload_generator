I have a problem. I need to format excel, and check it againts strings.

I already had the tools on excel, but that doesn't work in my macbook.

so I need solutions.

1. create solution to replace regexp on mac by changing two functions that use regex.
    a. search all total number within string and store it as array.
    b. changes all occurence to int only.

2. create a whole new tools using python maybe ?
    a. I need to make sure is regex exists within python or not.
        if it does, we can continue to install all tools required for the jobs.
